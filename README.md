About: This is the code of my NetDoodler main site that I'm connecting to local repositories.

Stuff To Improve: There are a lot of inline element things that need to go into css files, and the media queries need a cleaner template. (Keep now however that there were some very specific responsiveness I wanted to occur when viewed on tablets which is the reason for the multiple menus where two are always hidden). Feel free to do this work for me!

*Even though this is my current professional site, if you are a potential employer checking out my repositories for clean code, this repo is NOT meant to be a demonstration of that! Better repositories would be either the FreeBillingProgram, the Sudoku andrioid app, or OnlineDataFetcher since these were projects I recevied perfect scores on back in college!*
