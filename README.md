About: This is the code of my NetDoodler main site that I'm connecting to local repositories.

Stuff To Improve: There are a lot of inline element things that need to go into css files, and the media queries need a cleaner template. (Keep now however that there were some very specific responsiveness I wanted to occur when viewed on tablets which is the reason for the multiple menus where two are always hidden). Feel free to do this work for me!
