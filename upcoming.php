				<h2 style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print; margin-top: -43px; margin-bottom: 60px;" >(Just a Personal Work Journal Really....Which is also Public)</h2>
					<p style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print;"> Since blogs are about equally as stupid as bios, this page will be replaced with a portfolio section. </p>
					<p style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print;"> 1. Keep Adding More Images and Styles that are Seductive Ads to lure clients that need some original webdoodling done. Fix css media queries.</p>
					<p style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print;"> 2. Add a little chart showing what makes up a crayon minion: i.e. 10% Pokemon 10% Bugs Bunny 10% Hydrochlroic Acid (Stomach Acid) 10% Wax, 60% Despicable Me, and 100% MY copyright O.o. 
					<p style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print;"> 3. Make a Video that introduces the mysterious "Mr. Doodler" decisively, whom will be listening to his whacky clients while his "crayon minions" does his work for him paid in fish food. </p>				


					<p style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print;"> 3b. Add background art of a huge pyramid slightly off to the side on the services page and down below you see a desert and the crayon minions "slaving" away building it like they're in ancient egypt (maybe give couple of them cell phones too). Maybe draw much more of the pyramid that can be shown on screen so if the user really tries to zoom out they can see more and more of the pyramid.</p>

					<p style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print;"> 3c. First push for clients using linkedin, upwork, etc.,</p>
					<p style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print;"> 4. Adjust web site based on failures/difficulties that arise from first push and try, try, try again......</p>
					<p style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print;"> 5. Misc. "Fancy" front-end touches such as logo changing as user scrolls. <a href="#" role="button" onclick="showContent('contact.php');">Neat ideas are always welcome here!</a> </p>
					<p style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print;"> 6. Maybe start Designing some other NetDoodler charactatures.</p>
					<p style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print;"> 6b. Encase the "About the Head Doodler" in lightning or flames to make it look really cool and egotistically hilarious </p>
				
					<p style= "font-family: Maiandra GD, Tekton Pro, Movi Boli, Segoe Print;" 6-10. If enough people start to like NetDoodler, adding a backend DB to organize clients and start a chat forum. And maybe even start creating longer, fun-to-watch cartoon animations free to watch!</p>
